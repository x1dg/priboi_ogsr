<text>Small automatic SR-3 "Vikhr" was developed on the basis of the AS-VAL, for Special Forces units. The SR-3 is a very small size weapon, comparable to the size of small submachineguns, but clearly superior to their firepower through the use of special armour cartridges SP-6, SP-5, and PAB-9 (9x39mm). Unlike the AS-VAL, SR-3 does not have a silencer, and the barrel does not support mounting of a silencer.\ N Ammunition: \ n 9x39mm PAB-9, \ n 9x39 mm armour-SP-6, \ n sniper 9x39mm SP-5. </text>

		<text>The AK-103 is a modern Russian-built version of the famous AK-47 assault rifle, chambered for the 7.62x39mm M43 round. It combines the developments made in the AK-74 and AK-101 with a use of plastics to replace metal or wooden components wherever possible to reduce overall weight. The AK-103 can be fitted with a tactical light, laser sight, telescopic sight, suppressor, and the GP-25 grenade launcher. The AK-103 is in limited service with selected units in the Russian army, and is already being exported to other countries such as Venezuela.\n   Ammo:\ 7.62x39mm (All Types)</text>

		<text>In 1976 a shortened version of the MP5A2 was introduced, the MP5K (K – Kurz), designed with clandestine operations and special services in mind primarily for close quarters battle. This SMG does not have a shoulder stock (the receiver end was covered with a flat cover), and the bolt and receiver were shortened at the rear. The resultant lighter bolt led to a higher rate of fire than the standard MP5. The barrel, cocking handle and its cover were shortened and a vertical foregrip was used to replace the standard handguard. The barrel ends at the base of the foresight, which prevents the use of any sort of muzzle device.\n MP5K submachine guns are produced (by HK and under license in Iran and Turkey) in four different versions: the MP5K, MP5KA4, MP5KA1, MP5KA5, where the first two variants have adjustable, open-type iron sights (with a notched rotary drum), and the two remaining variants - fixed open sights, however the front sight post was changed and a notch was cut into the receiver top cover. The MP5K retained the capability to use optical sights through the use of an adapter.\n Ammunition:\n 9x19mm FMJ \n 9x19mm BP1.</text>

		<text>The history of the development of M1891 rifle is somewhat shady and controversial. During the official trials, two designs were selected for final - one by Russian army captain Mosin, and another, by the Belgian designer Nagant. Final design, adopted by the Commission, utilized features from both, and Leon Nagant was paid for his part, some very serious amount of money. Mosin received a rank promotion and worked on the Sestroretsk arsenal, trying to set this rifle for production. Russia's Imperial Army in 1891 adopted this rifle as the standard issue to infantry. It was used in every conflict involving Russia, & The Soviet Union, since 1891. After the 2nd World War it was replaced by the SKS, and AK-47 as the standard issue weapon. In 1930 the rifle was updated, and the production of M1891/30 pattern began. The rifle was produced in vast quantities, and is now widely used as a hunting rifle in many countries.
